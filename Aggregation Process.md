The aggregation process involves collecting, combining, and assembling the rendered outputs from different nodes into a final composite output. This is crucial for producing coherent results, especially when tasks have been segmented and processed independently.

#### 1. **Result Collection**

1. **Task Completion Notification**:
   - Each node, upon completing its assigned task, notifies the render farm management software (e.g., Thinkbox Deadline, Qube!, or Royal Render) that the task is complete.

2. **Result Upload**:
   - Rendered outputs (frames, tiles, layers) are uploaded to a central storage location, often using a cloud storage solution like Oracle Cloud Object Storage.
   - Metadata about each rendered output (task ID, frame number, tile coordinates, layer information) is also uploaded to assist with aggregation.

#### 2. **Validation and Verification**

1. **Integrity Check**:
   - Ensure that the uploaded files are not corrupted. This can involve checksum verification or other file integrity checks.
   - Validate that the rendered outputs match the expected dimensions, formats, and other specifications.

2. **Error Handling**:
   - If errors are detected (e.g., missing tiles, incomplete frames), the render farm management software can reassign those tasks to be re-rendered.
   - Implement retries for transient errors and notify administrators for persistent issues.

#### 3. **Data Aggregation**

1. **Tile-Based Aggregation (for High-Resolution Still Images)**:
   - **Tile Positioning**: Collect all tiles corresponding to different sections of the image.
   - **Image Stitching**: Combine the tiles into a single high-resolution image. Ensure that tiles align correctly to avoid visual artifacts.
   - **Edge Blending**: Handle overlapping areas and blend edges to create a seamless image.

2. **Frame-Based Aggregation (for Animations)**:
   - **Frame Sequencing**: Collect frames rendered by different nodes and sequence them in the correct order.
   - **Quality Check**: Verify that all frames are present and that they transition smoothly without visual inconsistencies.

3. **Layer-Based Aggregation (for Complex Scenes)**:
   - **Layer Collection**: Gather all rendered layers or passes (e.g., diffuse, specular, shadows, reflections).
   - **Layer Compositing**: Combine these layers into a final composite image using a compositing software (e.g., Nuke, After Effects).
   - **Effect Application**: Apply post-processing effects such as color correction, depth of field, and motion blur.

#### 4. **Final Composition and Output**

1. **Compositing**:
   - Use compositing tools to assemble the final image or sequence.
   - Adjust individual layers or frames as needed to ensure visual coherence and desired effects.

2. **Quality Assurance**:
   - Review the final composite for any visual artifacts, color mismatches, or other issues.
   - Perform detailed checks on critical areas identified during the rendering process.

3. **Output Formatting**:
   - Export the final composite into the required format(s) (e.g., PNG, JPEG, EXR for still images; MP4, MOV for animations).
   - Ensure that the output adheres to the specifications provided by the client or project requirements.

#### 5. **Delivery and Archiving**

1. **Delivery**:
   - Transfer the final output to the client or project repository.
   - Use secure file transfer methods to ensure data integrity and confidentiality.

2. **Archiving**:
   - Archive the project files, including scene files, assets, intermediate renders, and final output.
   - Maintain a structured and accessible archive for future reference or re-rendering needs.

### Example Aggregation Workflow

**Scenario**: Aggregating a 4K high-resolution still image rendered in tiles.

1. **Result Collection**:
   - Tiles are rendered and uploaded to Oracle Cloud Object Storage. Each tile is 512x512 pixels.
   - Metadata includes tile coordinates and render completion status.

2. **Validation and Verification**:
   - Checksum verification ensures no tiles are corrupted.
   - Validate that all 64 tiles (8x8 grid) are present.

3. **Data Aggregation**:
   - **Tile Positioning**: Retrieve tiles and position them in the correct grid layout.
   - **Image Stitching**: Combine tiles using stitching software to form the final 4K image.
   - **Edge Blending**: Blend edges to ensure seamless transitions between tiles.

4. **Final Composition and Output**:
   - Use image editing software (e.g., Photoshop) for any final adjustments.
   - Export the final image in the required format (e.g., TIFF for high-quality print).

5. **Delivery and Archiving**:
   - Deliver the final image to the client via a secure link.
   - Archive the project files and final image in a structured folder on Oracle Cloud Object Storage.
