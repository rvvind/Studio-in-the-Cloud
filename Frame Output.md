This process involves finalizing the rendered frame, applying any necessary post-processing, and saving the output to the specified location. Here's how it works step by step:

### Frame Output Breakdown

#### 1. **Render Pass Management**
- **Combine Render Passes**: If the rendering process generated multiple passes (e.g., beauty, shadow, reflection), these passes are combined to create the final image.
- **Pass Processing**: Each pass may undergo specific processing, such as tone mapping or exposure adjustment, before being combined.

#### 2. **Post-Processing**
- **Color Correction**: Adjust color balance, brightness, contrast, and saturation to achieve the desired look.
- **Gamma Correction**: Apply gamma correction to ensure correct display on different devices.
- **Tone Mapping**: Convert the high dynamic range (HDR) image to a low dynamic range (LDR) image if necessary.
- **Special Effects**: Apply additional effects like bloom, lens flares, and vignetting.

#### 3. **File Formatting**
- **Determine Output Format**: Choose the file format based on user settings (e.g., PNG, JPEG, EXR).
- **Bit Depth and Compression**: Set the bit depth (e.g., 8-bit, 16-bit) and apply compression if needed (e.g., lossy for JPEG, lossless for PNG).

#### 4. **Metadata Embedding**
- **Embed Metadata**: Add metadata to the image file, such as render settings, frame number, and scene information.

#### 5. **Image Saving**
- **Set Output Path**: Define the path where the final image will be saved.
- **Save Image**: Save the image to the specified location with the correct file naming convention.

#### 6. **Quality Check**
- **Automated Checks**: Perform automated checks to ensure the output image meets quality standards (e.g., no missing textures, correct color range).
- **Manual Review**: Optionally, a manual review process may be conducted to verify the image quality.

#### 7. **Uploading and Distribution**
- **Central Storage Upload**: Upload the final image to a central storage system if required.
- **Client Distribution**: Distribute the image to the client or the next stage in the pipeline, such as compositing or editing.

### Example Frame Output Workflow

**Scenario**: Saving a final frame of an animation using EXR format.

1. **Render Pass Management**
   - Combine beauty pass, shadow pass, and reflection pass.
   - Apply exposure adjustment to each pass before combining.

2. **Post-Processing**
   - Color Correction: Adjust brightness and contrast to enhance the image.
   - Gamma Correction: Apply gamma correction for accurate display.
   - Tone Mapping: Convert HDR image to LDR for final output.
   - Special Effects: Add a subtle bloom effect to bright areas.

3. **File Formatting**
   - Output Format: EXR for high dynamic range.
   - Bit Depth: Set to 16-bit for detailed color information.
   - Compression: Apply lossless compression to reduce file size.

4. **Metadata Embedding**
   - Embed metadata such as frame number, render settings, and scene name.

5. **Image Saving**
   - Set Output Path: `/renders/ProjectX/frame_001.exr`.
   - Save Image: Save the EXR file to the specified path.

6. **Quality Check**
   - Automated Checks: Verify no missing textures and correct color range.
   - Manual Review: Optional manual review to ensure high quality.

7. **Uploading and Distribution**
   - Central Storage Upload: Upload `frame_001.exr` to central storage for backup.
   - Client Distribution: Send the image file to the client or compositing team.

### Flow Diagram Representation

Hereâ€™s how you can visualize the frame output process in a flow diagram:

```

Each step ensures that the final rendered frame is processed, saved, and distributed correctly, maintaining high quality and adhering to the specified output requirements.
