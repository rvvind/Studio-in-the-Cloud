This process involves ensuring that the rendered frames or images are correctly submitted to the designated storage locations and made available for further use. Here's how it works step by step:

### Result Submission Breakdown

#### 1. **Output Verification**
- **Automated Quality Checks**: Perform automated checks to ensure that the rendered output meets the required quality standards (e.g., no missing textures, correct resolution).
- **Manual Review**: Optionally, conduct a manual review to verify the quality and completeness of the rendered frames or images.

#### 2. **File Naming and Organization**
- **File Naming Convention**: Ensure that the rendered files follow a consistent naming convention (e.g., `frame_001.png`, `scene_final.exr`).
- **Directory Structure**: Organize the files into the correct directory structure (e.g., `/renders/ProjectX/frames/`).

#### 3. **Metadata Attachment**
- **Embed Metadata**: Attach relevant metadata to the files, such as render settings, frame numbers, scene names, and timestamps.

#### 4. **Data Packaging**
- **Compress Files**: Optionally compress the files into a single archive (e.g., ZIP, TAR) for easier transfer.
- **Checksum Generation**: Generate checksums (e.g., MD5, SHA-256) for the files to ensure data integrity during transfer.

#### 5. **Upload to Central Storage**
- **Select Storage Location**: Determine the central storage location for the rendered output (e.g., a cloud storage bucket, a network-attached storage (NAS) system).
- **Upload Files**: Upload the files to the selected storage location, ensuring that the transfer is reliable and secure.

#### 6. **Validation of Uploaded Data**
- **Integrity Checks**: Validate the uploaded files by comparing checksums to ensure no data corruption occurred during the transfer.
- **Completeness Check**: Verify that all expected files have been uploaded and are accessible.

#### 7. **Notification and Logging**
- **Log Submission Details**: Log details of the submission process, including file names, sizes, upload times, and any encountered issues.
- **Notification**: Notify relevant stakeholders (e.g., render farm manager, client, compositing team) that the rendered output is available.

#### 8. **Backup and Archiving**
- **Backup Files**: Create backups of the rendered output in a separate location for redundancy.
- **Archiving**: Archive the project files and rendered output for long-term storage and future reference.

### Example Result Submission Workflow

**Scenario**: Submitting the final frames of an animation to cloud storage.

1. **Output Verification**
   - Automated Quality Checks: Verify resolution and absence of missing textures.
   - Manual Review: Conduct a visual inspection of the first and last frames.

2. **File Naming and Organization**
   - Naming Convention: Ensure files are named `frame_001.png`, `frame_002.png`, etc.
   - Directory Structure: Organize files into `/renders/ProjectX/frames/`.

3. **Metadata Attachment**
   - Embed metadata: Add render settings, frame numbers, and timestamps to the EXIF data of each PNG file.

4. **Data Packaging**
   - Compress Files: Create a ZIP archive of all frames.
   - Checksum Generation: Generate an MD5 checksum for the ZIP archive.

5. **Upload to Central Storage**
   - Select Storage Location: Choose a cloud storage bucket for upload.
   - Upload Files: Use a reliable and secure method to upload the ZIP archive to the cloud storage.

6. **Validation of Uploaded Data**
   - Integrity Checks: Compare MD5 checksums of the local and uploaded ZIP archive.
   - Completeness Check: Verify that all frames are accessible in the cloud storage.

7. **Notification and Logging**
   - Log Submission Details: Record file names, sizes, upload times, and checksums.
   - Notification: Send an email to the compositing team and client with the upload details.

8. **Backup and Archiving**
   - Backup Files: Copy the ZIP archive to a separate NAS system.
   - Archiving: Archive the project files and rendered output for future reference.
