This is the core phase where the actual rendering of the scene happens. It involves several steps that ensure the scene is processed correctly to produce the final image or frame.

### Rendering Execution Breakdown

#### 1. **Scene Data Loading**
- **Load Scene Assets**: Load all necessary assets (geometry, textures, materials) into memory.
- **Scene Assembly**: Assemble the scene using the loaded assets, ensuring all elements are correctly positioned and configured.

#### 2. **Ray Tracing and Rasterization**
- **Primary Ray Casting**: Cast primary rays from the camera to determine visible surfaces.
- **Shading and Lighting**: Calculate lighting and shading for the visible surfaces, taking into account direct and indirect illumination.
- **Secondary Rays**: Cast secondary rays for reflections, refractions, and global illumination.

#### 3. **Sampling and Anti-Aliasing**
- **Pixel Sampling**: Sample multiple points within each pixel to reduce aliasing and improve image quality.
- **Denoising**: Apply denoising algorithms to smooth out noise from ray tracing, especially in global illumination and shadow areas.

#### 4. **Lighting Calculation**
- **Direct Illumination**: Calculate direct light contributions from all light sources.
- **Indirect Illumination**: Calculate indirect light contributions from reflected and refracted rays.
- **Ambient Occlusion**: Compute ambient occlusion to simulate soft global illumination shadows.

#### 5. **Shader Execution**
- **Material Shaders**: Execute material shaders to determine the color and appearance of surfaces.
- **Procedural Shaders**: Execute any procedural shaders for patterns, textures, and special effects.

#### 6. **Post-Processing Effects**
- **Depth of Field**: Simulate the effect of camera depth of field, blurring areas out of focus.
- **Motion Blur**: Apply motion blur to objects in motion relative to the camera.
- **Color Correction**: Adjust color balance, exposure, and other color properties.

#### 7. **Image Composition**
- **Layer Composition**: Combine different render passes (e.g., beauty, shadow, reflection) into a final image.
- **Final Output**: Compile the final image or frame, ensuring all layers and effects are correctly applied.

#### 8. **Saving and Output**
- **Save Image**: Save the final rendered image or frame to the specified output path.
- **Upload Result**: Upload the rendered result to central storage if required.

### Example Rendering Execution Workflow

**Scenario**: Rendering a single frame using V-Ray Renderer.

1. **Scene Data Loading**
   - Load geometry (e.g., character models, environment).
   - Load textures (e.g., diffuse maps, bump maps).
   - Assemble the scene with all objects in their correct positions.

2. **Ray Tracing and Rasterization**
   - Cast primary rays from the camera to each pixel on the screen.
   - Calculate intersections with geometry to determine visible surfaces.
   - Cast secondary rays for reflections on a glass surface.

3. **Sampling and Anti-Aliasing**
   - Sample 16 points per pixel for anti-aliasing.
   - Apply denoising to smooth out noise in the final image.

4. **Lighting Calculation**
   - Calculate direct illumination from a point light and an HDRI map.
   - Compute indirect illumination using global illumination techniques.
   - Calculate ambient occlusion for soft shadows in corners.

5. **Shader Execution**
   - Execute material shaders for metal, glass, and skin materials.
   - Apply a procedural noise shader to the terrain for added detail.

6. **Post-Processing Effects**
   - Apply depth of field effect based on the camera's focus settings.
   - Apply motion blur to a fast-moving object.
   - Perform color correction to adjust the overall tone of the image.

7. **Image Composition**
   - Combine the beauty pass, shadow pass, and reflection pass.
   - Ensure all layers are correctly blended and effects applied.

8. **Saving and Output**
   - Save the final image as `frame_001.png`.
   - Upload `frame_001.png` to the central storage location.
